## 🧩 Overview  

OSX Uninstaller offers a streamlined way to fully remove apps and all the hidden fragments they leave behind on macOS. Instead of relying on the standard Trash method — which often leaves support files scattered across your system — this tool performs a smart, targeted scan to uncover every trace connected to the unwanted software.  

Perfect for users who frequently test applications or those who want to reclaim lost storage space, OSX Uninstaller displays your installed apps in a clear, organized layout. With a single selection, it identifies associated caches, preferences, temporary files, and deeper system components, giving you full control over what stays and what goes.  

Its scanning engine digs into the Library directories and other concealed areas where leftover files tend to hide. Removing these remnants not only improves system cleanliness but also helps prevent errors or conflicts when reinstalling apps later.  

Optimized for modern macOS versions and supporting both Intel and Apple Silicon processors, OSX Uninstaller runs lightly in the background and is simple enough for everyday use. Whether you’re clearing out stubborn apps, performing maintenance, or refreshing your system environment before a macOS upgrade, this tool provides a clean and safe removal process from start to finish.
